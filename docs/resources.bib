  abstract = {Blockchain is considered a distributed ledger that can transact securely and trustfully without involving any third party. It has caused a lot of interest in various sectors, like government, finance, banking, etc. Blockchain technology is suitable for areas where multiple data storage and transaction types generally require the third party to authenticate the transactions involving transaction cost and authentication issues. In this paper, various aspects of Blockchain technology applications in public concern sectors have been analyzed in detail. This paper also reviews the multiple case studies and implementations of Blockchain technology in these sectors and their current status that provide a detailed insight into all the aspects of its application. This paper finally comes up with various implementation requirements in Government, Health, Finance, Economics, and Energy. Further, it identifies the challenges in successfully implementing Blockchain technology in these mentioned sectors to provide a reference for future deployments.}

The rise of blockchain technology has paved the way for the development of self-sovereign identity (SSI)—a new class of user-controlled resilient identity management systems that are enabled by distributed ledger technology. This paper examines how self-sovereign identity management can be used in a public transportation sector that spans different operators in multiple countries. Specifically, the paper explores how a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system can draw on the SSI framework to provide high-level security and transparency for all involved parties in public transportation ecosystems. Accordingly, building on analyses of the existing public transportation ticketing solutions, we elicited requirements of a comparable system based on the SSI principles. Next, we developed a low-fidelity prototype to showcase how passengers can utilize standardized travel credentials that are valid across different transportation networks in Europe. The proposed system eliminates the need for multiple travel cards (i.e., one for each transportation provider) and empowers individuals to have better control over the use of their identities while they utilize interoperable ticketing systems across Europe. Overall, building on the public transportation case, we offer a proof-of-concept that shows how individuals can better manage their identity credentials via the SSI framework.}

Blockchain can be incorporated to improve security, privacy, and data transparency both for small and large enterprises. Industry 4.0 is a synthesis of the new production methods that allow manufacturers to achieve their target more rapidly. Research has been conducted on various Industry 4.0 technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, and Blockchain, and how they could create significant interruptions in recent years. These technologies provide various possibilities in the world of manufacturing and supply chain. Blockchain is a technology that has gained much recognition and can enhance the manufacturing and supply chain environment. Various fields now have fascinating insights into the advantages of blockchain. Several research articles on “Blockchain” and “Industry 4.0″ from Google Scholar, Scopus, and other relevant sources are identified and reviewed for this study. This paper discusses the major potential of Blockchain in Industry 4.0. Various drivers, enablers, and associated capabilities of Blockchain technology for Industry 4.0 are discussed for insights. Different Industry 4.0 spheres/sub-domains for Blockchain technology realisation are also discussed. Finally, we have identified and studied fourteen significant applications of Blockchain in Industry 4.0. It is a range of new developments and hope for immense opportunities that are changing Industry 4.0. This technology would work to achieve amplified outcomes and work individually to enhance the process.}

Signature size in a `typical' system might range from a few hundred bytes to a few kilobytes, and generation of a signature might require a few hundred to a few thousand computations of the underlying conventional encryption function.},

  abstract = {Moving from fossil fuels toward renewable resources of energy has a worldwide consensus. Solar energy alone can satisfy all our energy requirements since the earth receives 725 ZJ of energy from the sun each year while total human energy consumption in 2019 was 0.584 ZJ. The 2010s is highlighted as a transitional decade when the photovoltaic conversion industry transformed from a subsidized to a profitable energy sector. While photovoltaic energy conversion is a clean process, technologies for producing photovoltaic materials and solar panels affect the environment. The utilization of photovoltaic materials with low impact on the environment during the entire life cycle will mark the beginning of the sustainable transition toward 100\% clean renewable energy sources in a sustainable manner. Thus far, only perovskite compounds have the potential to satisfy these requirements because of their theoretical conversion efficiencies, ease of synthesis, production scalability, adaptability, and comparability to existing photovoltaic systems. In this article, the rise of the photovoltaic industry in the last decade is shown and requirements in further transition from renewable to clean sources of renewable energy are foreseen.}

In particular, it tests the hypothesis that due to market imperfections, namely because of higher investment risk, higher capital constraints and higher transaction costs, TGC schemes will be associated with excess profits for renewable electricity generating firms. The results somewhat support this hypothesis, showing that electricity generating firms, operating in EU countries that implemented TGC, were more profitable compared to FIT firms.}

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) concept, focusing on four different components that we identified as essential to the architecture. Self-Sovereign Identity is enabled by the new development of blockchain technology. Through the trustless, decentralised database that is provided by a blockchain, classic Identity Management registration processes can be replaced. We start off by giving a simple overview of blockchain based SSI, introducing an architecture overview as well as relevant actors in such a system. We further distinguish two major approaches, namely the Identifier Registry Model and its extension the Claim Registry Model. Subsequently we discuss identifiers in such a system, presenting past research in the area and current approaches in SSI in the context of Zooko’s Triangle. As the user of an SSI has to be linked with his digital identifier we also discuss authentication solutions. Most central to the concept of an SSI are the verifiable claims that are presented to relying parties. Resources in the field are only loosely connected. We will provide a more coherent view of verifiable claims in regards to blockchain based SSI and clarify differences in the used terminology. Storage solutions for the verifiable claims, both on- and off-chain, are presented with their advantages and disadvantages.}
